# Hash_Changer
Changes the hash value of a file. The intended use is to run this on a .py file pre-compilation to exe in order to change the hash value of whatever you are creating. 
Changes the hash of a file by adding a random 128 bit string to it. As stated above this is meant for a python script, this means it writes the string in as a python comment.
